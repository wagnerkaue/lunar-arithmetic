According to Wikipedia:

Lunar arithmetic, formerly called dismal arithmetic, is a version of arithmetic in which the addition and multiplication operations on digits are defined as the max and min operations. Thus, in lunar arithmetic,

2 + 7 = max{2, 7} = 7

2 Ã— 7 = min{2, 7} = 2

It compares digit by digit of the numbers, not the whole part of them
